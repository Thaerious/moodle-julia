            Julia natively supports threaded operations. Until recently the thread library was still considered
            experimental so some of the the interfaces may change. To enable threading set an environment
            variable to let Julia know how many threads are available. Below are the commands used for Linux
            bash or Windows powershell.&nbsp; You can include this with the executable when running Julia in
            script mode.<br></span>Verify you are running with multiple threads by using the '<b>nthreads'</b>&nbsp;function
            from the
            '<b>Threads'</b>&nbsp;module.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each thread has an identification number, you can read this
            number with the '<b>threadid</b>' function.&nbsp; The main thread has a thread id of '<b>1</b>'.
            As of Julia 1.5 you can use the -t or --threads command line flag.
        </p>

    <h2>Tasks</h2>
    <div class="contents">
        <p>
            A task is used to execute a no-argument function in a thread.
            Tasks are a control flow feature which allow computations to be suspended and resumed.
            A task is analogous to a lightweight thread found in other languages.&nbsp;
            A task can be interrupted to&nbsp; process another task, resuming the first task upon completion.&nbsp;
            Tasks are not inherently threaded, nor is threads the only place they are used.
            However, they are returned by the <b>@spawn</b> macro, which we will introduce shortly.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can create your own tasks with the <b>Task()</b> constructor though this is often not necessary.&nbsp;
            To start a
            task use the <b>schedule</b>&nbsp;function. To wait for a task to complete, in a threaded context,
            use the
            <b>wait</b> function.&nbsp;
            There are also functions available to poll if a task has started, and/or completed.&nbsp; Use
            <b>fetch</b>&nbsp;to
            retrieve the task value, but note that this method will block until the task is completed.
        </p>

        The following is a function that eats up computation.  We will use it in the demonstration to follow.
        Save it as under "doStuff.jl".
        <pre class="block-code">
function doStuff(x)
    z = 1.3;
    for j in 1:0.5:(17 * x)
        for i in 1:10e5
            if (z % 2 > 1)
                z = z + j;
            else
                z = z - j;
            end
        end
    end
    return log(10, z)
end

    <h2>@threads Macro</h2>
    <div class="contents">
        <p>
            Julia provided a macro to parallelize for-loops called '@threads'.&nbsp; This
            macro spawns the
            maximum number of new threads (see nthreads) and splits the for loop iterations among the threads.&nbsp;
            A barrier is
            placed at the end of
            the loop, outside repeated logic, which will wait for all threads to complete before allowing the
            code
            to move on.&nbsp;
            The following example demonstrates this by loading an array with the thread id.&nbsp; &nbsp;

    <h2>Race Condition</h2>
    <div class="contents">
        <p>
            A race condition can occur any time more than one threads attempts to change the
            value of a
            shared resource.&nbsp; The side effect being an inconsistent value. It happens because most
            operations
            in high level
            languages are actually
            multiple low level instructions.&nbsp; Depending on when these instructions actually occur, the
            value of
            a computation
            may change.&nbsp; In the following example we deliberately cause a race condition.
        </p>
        <pre class="block-code">

function serial(ptrInt)
    for i in 1:10000000
        ptrInt[] += 1
    end
    return ptrInt[]
end

function race(ptrInt)
    Threads.@threads for i in 1:10000000
        ptrInt[] += 1
    end
    return ptrInt[]
end

function atomic(atomicInt)
    Threads.@threads for i in 1:10000000

end

function mutex(aLock, ptrInt)
    Threads.@threads for i in 1:10000000
        lock(aLock)
            ptrInt[] += 1
        unlock(aLock)
    end
    return ptrInt[]
end

@time println(race(Ref(0)))
@time println(atomic(Threads.Atomic{Int}(0)))
@time println(mutex(ReentrantLock(), Ref(0)))
        </pre>
        <p>
            We first create a point to an Integer, and then create a parallel loop that increments the value.&nbsp;
            In a single
            threaded scenario the value would equal 1000.&nbsp; However, because the '<b>+=</b>' operator is
            actually 'read-increment-write' the individual threads will often be holding the incorrect value.&nbsp;
            To fix this we will use an '<b>atomic'&nbsp;</b>value.&nbsp; An
            <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/multi-threading/#Base.Threads.Atomic">atomic type</a>
            holds a reference to a primitive value that can only be
            accessed in a
            thread safe manner.&nbsp; Atomic operations are identified by the prefix '<b>atomic_</b>'.&nbsp; You

        You can access values atomically, which means it guarantees that the operation will not be split.
        A primitive type value can be wrapped in an atomic to protect it from race conditions.

    <h2>Mutual Exclusion Locks</h2>
    <div class="contents">
        <p>
            A mutual exclusion lock, known as a 'Mutex', prevents multiple threads
            from accessing a
            protected block of code.&nbsp; It works by requiring a thread to acquire a lock on a portion of
            code,
            and only allowing
            one thread at a
            time to acquire this lock.&nbsp; Each lock must be accompanied by a corresponding unlock operation.&nbsp;
            You will
            typically put Mutex locks around segments of code that needs to perform a read and corresponding
            write
            on a shared
            variable.&nbsp; As such
            a Mutex prevents race conditions.<br><br>There are two types of locks in Julia, the '<a
                href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/parallel/#Base.ReentrantLock" target="_blank">Reentrant'&nbsp;</a>lock,
            and the spin lock.&nbsp; The '<a
                href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/multi-threading/#Base.Threads.SpinLock"
                target="_blank">S</a>pinLock'&nbsp;will continuously try to acquire the lock in a tight
            loop.&nbsp; This type of lock should only be used around small, quick segments of code.&nbsp; If the
            same thread
            attempts to acquire the lock multiple times without
            releasing it a deadlock condition will occur.&nbsp; The 'Reentrant' lock, as per it's name, will
            allow a
            thread to
            acquire the lock multiple times.
