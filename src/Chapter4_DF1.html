        <h3>Data Frames as in R and Python</h3>
        Data frame is a common form of data storage with associated operations,
        suitable for tabulated data processing.
        One can think of data frame as follows:

        <ul>
            <li>Think of a matrix. A matrix contains rows and columns.
            <li>A data frame, like a matrix, but more than that. It is a list of
                vectors. Each vector - the column of the frame - has the same length
                but different vectors may have different types.
            <li>Each column may have name.
            <li>Typical use - data stored in a spreadsheet.
            <li>When talking about data frame, we refer to both the dataset and
                the common operations associated with it, enabled by the data frame
                package(s).
            <li>Almost never need to write your owen code in any language to do
                what you want to do!
        </ul>

        What kind of common tasks do we often need to do?
        <ul>
            <li>Extracting a row or column from a spreadsheet.
            <li>Extracting a subset, e.g. a range of rows and/or columns.
            <li>Selecting rows and columns based on certain criteria.
            <li>Sorting by columns.
            <li>Aggregation, e.g. find the max, min, mean, etc. of some column by group in a specified column, etc.
        </ul>


        <i>This is by no means a complete coverage of the rich language features.
            Instead, it is an introduction to a list of key pointers,
            so the interested individuals may follow and explore at their own time.
