        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Unit 1 covers the basics of writing and executing code in Julia. This lesson introduces you to the
            Julia programming language and it's basic constructs. Targeted towards users who have not used Julia
            language in the past, minimal programming language experience is reuired. As such, we will not be going to
            dive too deeply into the 'why' things are done, but focus on the 'how' things are done. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to begin programming in Julia you will need some way to execute your source code.&nbsp; There are
            two ways to do this: <i><b>interactively</b></i> on the command line, or from a <i><b>file</b></i>
            with the runtime interpreter.&nbsp; The first is good for prototyping and learning, while the second is what
            you will use to run the code in production.
        </p>

        <h3>REPL</h3>
        <p>
            The REPL is the command line interactive interface&nbsp;for Julia; it stands for&nbsp;
            <b>R</b>ead-<b>E</b>val-<b>P</b>rint-<b>L</b>oop, and is used to execute code interactively.&nbsp; When you
            develop and execute Julia code you will do so by writing Julia source files, and executing then in your&nbsp;
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator">terminal</a>.&nbsp; The REPL is a
            handy tool for just trying out small snippets of code.&nbsp; In the first unit we will use the
            REPL to demonstrate the introductory concepts.&nbsp; Later in the course you will execute code
            non-interactively in script mode.
        </p>
        <p>
            When inside the REPL the built in documentation can be accessed by prepending a command the '?' symbol.&nbsp;&nbsp;For
            example, if you type&nbsp;<span class="inline-code">?print</span>&nbsp;you will get the help page for the
            built in print function.
        </p>
        <p>
            To start an interactive session, open up your terminal and type <span class="inline-code">Julia</span> on
            the command line, you should see the following.&nbsp;To exit simply type
            <span class="inline-code">exit()</span>.
            If you are executing this code in the Graham cluster environment, you will find a link at the bottom of the
            page for loading modules.
        </p>

        <p>
            The REPL starts in the default Julian prompt mode.
            In the REPL you will notice that the last value computed is printed out, end a line with a semicolon ';' to
            suppress this behaviour.
            This last value is also stored in the variable 'ans'.
            Most console programs will allow you to clear the screen with [CTRL]-L.
        </p>

        <pre class="block-code flush">

            julia> 2 + 1
            3

            julia> ans
            3

            julia> 3 + 5;
        </pre>
        <div class="footer">Test out simple operations in the REPL.</div>

        <p>
            You can enter shell mode by pressing the ';' key when the cursor is at the beginning of a line.
            This mode will allow you to enter a single shell command, then it returns to the default Julian prompt.
            If you want to enter multiple commands you can always start a new shell session with 'bash' (or 'sh).
            The shell prompt, shown below, indicates you are in shell mode.
        </p>
        <pre class="block-code flush">

        <div class="footer">Upon typing ';' the prompt changes to 'shell>'</div>

        <h3>Your first script</h3>
        <p>
            Just to warm up we will create the classic "Hello World" program.
            Use <b><i>vim</i></b> (or your preferred command line text editor) to create a 'helloWorld.jl' source file.
            In this file put the following into the file and save it.
        </p>

        <pre class="block-code flush">
            println("Hello World!");
        </pre>

        <p>
            To execute this script
        </p>

        <pre class="block-code flush">
            julia helloWorld.jl
        </pre>

        <p>
            You should see the result.
        </p>

        <pre class="block-code flush">
            Hello World!
        </pre>

        <p>
            You can run scripts on demand in the REPL by using the <b><i>include</i></b> keyword.
            This will execute all the commands in the script as if you had typed them in.  Using include twice may overwrite
            variables you have already used.
        </p>

        <pre class="block-code flush">
            julia> include("helloworld.jl")
            Hello World
        </pre>
        <div class="footer">Include is the same as typing the code.</div>

        <h3>Comments</h3>
        Single line comments start with the '#' symbol and run to the end of line.
        Multi-line comments start with th '#=' symbol and run until the '=#' symbol.
        <pre class="block-code flush">
            # single line comment
            #= multi-line
               comment
            =#
        </pre>
        <div class="footer">Comments are ignored by the interpreter.</div>
