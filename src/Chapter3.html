        <h3>Functions</h3>
            <p>Functions are basic building block of higher order programming languages.&nbsp; They permit easy code
                reuse
                and abstraction.&nbsp; In Julia, strictly speaking, a function is stateless and maps an input tuple
                (referred to as function arguments) to a return
                value.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; they are not purely functional, their behavior may be altered by the global
                state of the program.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can declare the return value of a function with the 'return'
                keyword.&nbsp;
                If 'return' is omitted than Julia
                will return the last evaluated statement.</p>
            <p>The traditional syntax for declaring a function in Julia is:</p>
            <div class="block-code">

                julia&gt; function foo(x, y)
                return x + y
                end
                foo (generic function with 1 method)

                julia&gt; foo(1, 2)
                3
            </div>
            <p>
                This consists of:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The 'function' keyword.</li>
                <li>A function name, in this case 'foo'.</li>
                <li>Zero or more comma delimited arguments, encompassed by parenthesis</li>
                <li>A function body containing the logic.</li>
                <li>the 'end' keyword.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To call a function you provide the function name with the desired parameters.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a compact way to declare a function which only consists of one statement.&nbsp; Both examples
                create
                the same function.
            </p>
            <div class="block-code">

                julia&gt; foo(x, y) = x + y
                foo (generic function with 1 method)
            </div>
            <p>
                The return statement can be omitted in both the compact and traditional syntax.&nbsp; The usage of the
                return
                relevant in the context of control flow.&nbsp; In the first function, 'f()' below there is only one path
                for
                the logic to take, so the return
                statement is omitted.&nbsp; However in the second function 'g()', there are two logical paths.&nbsp; One
                of
                these paths results in the function exiting early.&nbsp; We included the second return value for
                clarity, as
                it could be difficult for someone
                reading the code to easily see the logic without it.
            </p>
            <div class="block-code">

                julia&gt; function f(a, b)
                c = a + b
                c * 2
                end

                julia&gt; function g(a, b)
                if (a % 2 == 0) return b + 1 end
                return b
                end
            </div>
            </div>

    <div class="section">
    <h3>Return Type</h3>
    <p>
        The return type of a function can be declared using the
        <span class="inline-code">::</span>
        operator.&nbsp; The returned value will be converted
        to the declared type.&nbsp; In the example below the second function 'g()' will cause a conversion
        error.
    </p>
    <div class="block-code">

        julia&gt; function f()::String
        return "a"
        end

        julia&gt; function g()::Int
        return "a"
        end
    </div>
    <p>
        For function that return no value the convention is to return the singleton object 'nothing'.&nbsp; Note
        that
        a return statement by it's self by default returns the nothing object.&nbsp; Since Julia will return the
        last statement evaluated you can make
        nothing the last statement.&nbsp; The three functions below are logically the same.
    </p>
    <div class="block-code">

        julia&gt; function f()
        return
        end

        julia&gt; function f()
        end

        julia&gt; function f()
        nothing
        end

        julia&gt; typeof(f())
        Nothing
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Control Flow</h3>
            <p>
                Critical to all programming languages is controlling which statement to execute next.&nbsp; We will
                examine
                a
                number of familiar high level constructs that you will use to implement logic in your Julia
                program.&nbsp;
                In addition to controlling which statements
                get executed, some control statements.&nbsp; The function call, which you have already seen, performs a
                similar purpose.&nbsp; It also allows you to repeat code which in turn, reduces the complexity of your
                program.&nbsp; Reducing complexity, increases
                clarity, which allows you, the programmer, to avoid introducing bugs into your code.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the machine language level, control flow is achieved with a combination of a call stack, and
                manipulation
                of the instruction pointer.&nbsp; These manipulations, known as jumps, or 'goto' statements, are
                difficult
                to code in a clear and concise manner.&nbsp;
                As such, modern, high-level programming languages such as Julia us expressions which can categorized by
                their intended function:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Conditional branch, executing statement if a certain condition is met.</li>
                <li>Loop, executing a statement a divdetermined number of times, or until a condition is met.</li>
                <li>Subroutines, executing a remote block of code then returning to the point from which the call was
                    made.
                </li>
                <li>Stopping the program</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Two concepts closely related to control flow, are <i>compound expressions</i>, and <i>scope</i>.&nbsp; A
                compound expression is a series of code statements that are intended to be executed together.
            </p>
            <h3>Compound Expressions</h3>
            <p>
                In Julia, there are two flavours of compound expressions: begin-end blocks, and <span
                    class="inline-code">;</span>
                chains.&nbsp; Both evaluate
                several sub-expressions returning the result of the last expression evaluated.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
                    style="font-size: 0.9375rem;">The two following examples are functionally the same.</span>
            </p>
            <div class="block-code">

                julia&gt; z = begin
                x = 1
                y = 2
                x + y
                end
                3

                # chained expressions
                julia&gt; (z = x = 1; y = 2; x + y)
                3
            </div>
            <p>
                You will recognize the first example is the same as the body of a function.&nbsp; The second can also
                stand
                in as the body of a function.
            </p>
            <div class="block-code">

                # begin-end block
                julia&gt; foo(z) = (z = z + 2; z * 2)
                foo (generic function with 1 method)

                julia&gt; foo(101)
                206
            </div>
            <p>
                Within a control-flow structure a compound expression can go anywhere an expression can go.&nbsp; The
                next
                section will enumerate the control-flow structures available in Julia, then we will conclude this
                section
                with a number of examples.

        <h3>Conditional Evaluation: If-Then-Else</h3>
            <p>
                Commonly just called the 'if statement', this expression tests one or more boolean expressions,
                executing
                the
                first expression that evaluates as 'true'.&nbsp; If there is an 'else' statement, then the code block
                associated with that statement will be
                executed if all conditions evaluate to 'false'.
            </p>

                Basic if statement with one condition.&nbsp; This fuction evaluates whether or not a is even, if so it
                prints a
                statement.&nbsp; If not, it does nothing.
            </p>
            <div class="block-code">

                julia&gt; function f(a)
                if (a % 2 == 0)
                println("The number is even")
                end
                end
                f (generic function with 1 method)

                julia&gt; f(1)

                julia&gt; f(2)
                The number is even
            </div>
            <p>
                All if statements are terminated with the 'end' keyword. In this example we put in entire function on
                one
                line.
                While the function doens't need a terminal 'end' statement the 'if' expression does. While it is
                helpfull to
                know about compact functions,
                they can make the code difficult to read and should be used sparingly.

            <div class="block-code">

                julia&gt; f(a) = if (a % 2 == 0) println("The number is even") end
            </div>
            <p>
                This is known as an if-else statement. It will perform an action if the condition is true, and will
                perform
                a
                different action if the condition is false.
            </p>
            <div class="block-code">

                julia&gt; function f(a)
                if (a % 2 == 0)
                println("The number is even")
                else
                println("The number if false")
                end
                end
                f (generic function with 1 method)

                julia&gt; f(1)
                The number if false

                julia&gt; f(2)
                The number is even
            </div>
            <p>
                This is an example of an if-else-if statement.&nbsp; You can have as many 'elseif' conditions as you
                like.&nbsp;
                You can only have one 'else' condition and it must come last.&nbsp; Looking at the example, you will
                note
                that
                when we execute the function
                with the parameter '6', only the first condition is true.&nbsp; This is because a if statement will
                terminate on
                the first 'true' condition, even if other subsequent conditions may also be 'true'.
            </p>

                In this conditional we use multiple 'elseif' statements as well as putting two evaluations in one
                condition.
                The
                '&amp;&amp;' operator performs the logical 'and' on the two conditions.

        <h3>Loops</h3>
            <p>Loops are a powerful programming construct.&nbsp; The purpose of loops are to repeatedly execute a block
                of
                code.&nbsp; There are two flavours of loops: the <b>while </b>loop, and the <b>for </b>loop.&nbsp; The
                <b>while </b>loop
                repeats a code block until
                a given condition is met.&nbsp; The <b>for </b>repeats the code block a divdetermined number of
                times.&nbsp;
                While experimenting with loops in the REPL, <b>ctrl-c</b> will terminate an errant loop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                This for loop does the same
                job as the
                above while loop by iterating over a range as opposed to testing a condition.&nbsp; One thing to note
                about
                the
                for loop is the where the variable <b>i</b>&nbsp;is available.&nbsp; It does not exist outside of the
                loop,
                only
                within the loop, this is referred
                to as the <b>scope </b>of the variable.

                The <b>1:6</b> at the instantiation of the loop is known as <b>range </b>object.&nbsp; A range comes in
                one of two
                formats: 1) start:end or 2) start:step:end. You can also iterate over an array of values.

        <h3>Scope</h3>
        The term "Scope" refers to when a particular declared variable is valid.  It allows you to use the same variable
        name in different contexts.  For example, you can have two functions with the same variable, each with their
        own value.

        <div class="block-code" flush>
            function widget()
                c::Int = 5;
                println(c)
            end

            function notWidget()
                c::Float16 = 13.6
                println(c);
            end

            widget()
            notWidget()

            <div class="output">=== output ===
                5
                13.6
            </div></div>
        <div class="footer">Scope is not shared between functions</div>

        Besides functions, there are a number of language constructs that also provide scope.  There are two primary types
        of scope: global, and local.  Variables in the global scope can be accessed from anywhere.  Variables from the local
        scope can only be accessed from their code block, or a nested inner code block.

        In the following example the variable a is declared twice, once in global scope, once in local scope.  The local
        scope doesn't overwrite the local scope.  As you can see in the last print statement, the value initially set
        is still there.

        <div class="block-code" flush>
        a = 5

        function widget()
            a = 10
            println(a)
        end

        widget()
        println(a)

        <div class="output">=== output ===
        10
        5
        </div></div>
        <div class="footer">Global (module) scope vs local scope.</div>

        Note there is not truly 'global' scope.  All 'global' variables reside within a module namespace.  By default
        the module is 'Main'.  Here we use the 'names' command to list all the values in the 'Main' <i>namespace</i>.
        Take note, besides the expected names, 'Main', 'a', and 'widget', there is also the 'Base' and 'Core' modules.

        <div class="block-code" flush>
            a = 5

            function widget()
            end

            println(names(Main))

            <div class="output">=== output ===
            [:Base, :Core, :Main, :a, :widget]
            </div></div>
        <div class="footer">Contents of the Main module namespace.</div>

        Functions are "lexically scoped".  This means that functions inherit the variable from the module it's declared
        in, as opposed to the module it's executed in.  In the following example you can see that the Foo.foo() prints
        the 'x' from the 'Foo' module, independent of where the function was called.  To be pedantic we print off the
        two x values to show that they are different.
        <div class="block-code" flush>
            module Foo
                x = 1
                foo() = println(x)
            end;

            Foo.foo();

            module Bar
                import ..Foo
                x = 5
                Foo.foo()
            end;

            println(Foo.x);
            println(Bar.x);

            <div class="output">=== output ===
            1
            1
            1
            5
            </div></div>
            <div class="footer">Lexical scoping.</div>

        For loops, and while loops introduce their own local scope.  These follow the same rules as a function's local
        scope.  Note that If blocks and begin blocks do not introduce local scope.
        <div class="block-code" flush>
            x = 5

            for i in 1:4
            x = i * i
            println("$i $x")
            end

            println(x)
            <div class="output">=== output ===
            1 1
            2 4
            3 9
            4 16
            5
            </div></div>
        <div class="footer">For/While loops scoping.</div>

        <h4>Examples</h4>
        In this example the variable x is declared in the global scope of the Main (default) module.  When the function
        fidget refers to this variable it's references the global variable.
        <div class="block-code" flush>
            x = 5

            function fidget()
            println(x);
            end

            fidget()
            <div class="output">=== output ===
                5
            </div></div>
        <div class="footer">Global scope used inside a function</div>

        This example throws an error because the 'x = x + 7' line creates a local variable.  Once there is a local
        variable with the same name as a global variable, the function will attempt the reference the local variable.
        Since the variable is declared after it's used, an error is thrown.  To fix this we will add the 'global' keyword.
        <div class="block-code" flush>
            x = 5

            function fidget()
                println(x);
                x = x + 7
            end

            fidget()
            <div class="output">=== output ===
            ERROR: LoadError: UndefVarError: x not defined

        In this example the 'global' keyword let the interpreter know you mean to reassign a value to the global
        variable and not create a new local variable.  In practice however, this can be confusing and usages of globals
        should be limited and well documented.
        <div class="block-code" flush>
            x = 5

            function fidget()

        <h4>Caveat</h4>
        <p>
            The rules for scoping presented here are in a non-interactive context. In an interactive context (REPL)
            there is a different, more complicated, set of scoping rules. Since any code more complex than a few lines
            should be run non-interactively, we only cover the non-interactive case. For further information refer to
            the manual.
